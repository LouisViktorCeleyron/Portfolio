## Context
During my studies at **Rubika's Supinfogame**, the graduation project was the conception of a full **Vertical Slice** of a game. At the end of the fourth year, I joined the Tough Kookie Team! 

The game is a  groovy **beat them up with management features**.
 
As Tessa Kirby AKA Tough Kookie a famous actress and director, you have to shoot the bests actions movies of the 70's!​

The game is divided in three parts, the first one is a hub. In this part the player can choose his contract and interact with the crew and some props. In the second one the player set up the camera in the fight scene because the score only increases when the avatar is in front of the camera. In the last one the player fights waves of ninjas in front of the camera, trying to be as spectacular as possible.


​

## What I Did

### **Head Programmer**

As a head programmer on Tough Kookie, I was able to **interact and communicate** with everyone in the team. I used to do meetings with **Game designers and Artists as well as Programmers**. I listened to every poles’ needs and created **tools and nodes** to ease the work for everyone.

I oversaw the project's hierarchy. I choose to use a component-based hierarchy. UE4 is well adapted to this kind of hierarchy, and it allows programmers to work both in **Blueprint and C++**.

Every feature is coded in a component, and each component can be called by a character or an actor. I also used a child/parent system to ease the implementation of the component and the creation of new objects by the designers.

I used **Jira and Confluence** to make documents for the programmers and to set up deadlines and planning. It also helped us to organize our work and to assign tasks. 

​

  
### **Gameplay  and System Programmer**

I coded a feature of **level editing** which was unfortunately cut. I used the **Event Dispatcher System of UE**. I designed a system in which the player can create rooms and fills them with object usable in battle. 

I used the Game Instance feature of UE to **send data between the different part of the game** like the score, the position of the cameras, the selected contract, etc… 

I coded a system that allow the player to change the game mode in the same level, to avoid the game and levels designers to create a level for the set-up and a level for the fight.

I used the hierarchy to create a system of interactable object usable in all three part of the game, the designer could easily create new object and new behavior from blueprint.

I also programmed others features as the main title or a dialogue system and a lot of tiny UX things to make the game groovier.

​

### **Tool Designer**
I created a spline tool that allow the level designers and level builders to place walls and barriers with the good collision preset.

I also did a lot of **researches and retro engineering** to understand how the UI system of UE worked and I coded a new one adapted for the project. Compatible with the gamepad and that allow to launch UI-Fxs very easily. 

I created **generic function library and macro library** to simplify the workflow of the team.

## What I Learned

I acquire **skills in management** as the haed programmer of the team. I know how to work and listen the needs of everyone in a team. 

It was a one year and half project with a **preproduction, a production, and a post-production**. I could employ what I learnt in the preproduction to create hierarchy documents before the production to prevent conflicts.

I knew how to use a source control software before working on this project, but I deepen my knowledges, especially about tortoise SVN.

I learnt the **C++ workflow on UE4** with this project. I practised it to design nodes, component, etc.. I also learnt how to use the double workflow C++/Bp because everyone in the team was not a programmer who could do C++.

I also deepen my **knowledges about UE4**, working on a long project with this software allowed me to make experiment and learn all about tiny features of the soft. And there were two of us working every day on UE so each time one of us found something new he informed the other one.
