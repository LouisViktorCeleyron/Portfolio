## Context 

In the summer of 2024 I decided to make a system based game to have something to show and to share to my student as an exemple. 

These last years I have been playing a lot of Deckbuilding Rogue like (Balatro, Slay the spire, Astrea, Wildfrost etc...) and I have been thinking about my take on the genre for a little while. The project I wanted to do for my students was the occasion to put this Idea to the test.

My idea was to make a game where the player can launch action by combining elements. I started brainstorming and a lot of ideas came to my mind so I launched Unity and worked on the first prototype. 

## 1st Scope and future of the project

I wanted to make a 1st prototype of the project that would allow me to experiment with the concept and show a peak of the gameplay loop without going in all directions.

The elevator pitch of the game is : 

> *Battle oponent in turn based battle by combining elements to create powerful and various consequences. Each victory will grant you more elements and ressources to experiments and find the most powerfull combos to face randomly generated foes*

Here's what I hoped to do at the start of the project and what I've done.
