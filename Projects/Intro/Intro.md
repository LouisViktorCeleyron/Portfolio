## Context 

In the summer of 2024 I decided to make a system based game to have something to show and to share to my student as an exemple. 

These last years I have been playing a lot of Deckbuilding Rogue like (Balatro, Slay the spire, Astrea, Wildfrost etc...) and I have been thinking about my take on the genre for a little while. The project I wanted to do for my students was the occasion to put this Idea to the test. 

![Deckbuilders](https://github.com/LouisViktorCeleyron/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Intro/Pictures/Banner.png)

My idea was to make a game where the player can launch action by combining elements. I started brainstorming and a lot of ideas came to my mind so I launched Unity and worked on the first prototype. 


## Concept

The game is a rogue like deckbuilder. 

The elevator pitch of the game is : 

> *Battle oponent in turn based battle by combining elements to create powerful and various consequences. Each victory will grant you more elements and ressources to experiments and find the most powerfull combos to face randomly generated foes*

Here's what a standard game would look like :

> * Choose a starter deck of elements
> * Enter the 1st realm and fight the 1st foe 
> * In battle drag'n'drop elements onto another to launch consequences
> * Each time you'll defeat a foe you'll win monney and play the lotterie to win a random element to add to your deck
> * From time to time you'll enter a shop  or rest area
> * At the end of every realms you fight a boss, once you win you enter the next realm
> * If you loose you'll start all over again but you can try a new starter deck and/or try to manages your ressources differently


### Glossary

> **Element** : *Your deck is filled with elements. By combining them you can launch consequences.*

> **Consequences** :  *Theses are the actions you can launch with elements, your foes will launch one consequence every turn too. They can buff you, heal, inflict dammage and more !*

> **Status Effects** : Some consequences will give you or your opponent status effects. They can do a lot of different things like healing or damaging but also affect your precision, block dammages, and even generate elements!

> **Rast Area**

> **Shop**

## 1st Scope and future of the project

I wanted to make a 1st prototype of the project that would allow me to experiment with the concept and show a peak of the gameplay loop without going in all directions.

Here's what I hoped to do at the start of the project and what I've done.

### Gameplay üéÆ

|Objective|Done|Comment|
|---|---|---|
|3 Realms|‚úÖ||
|4 types of foes and 1 boss/Realm|‚úÖ||
|10ish elements|‚úÖ||
|20ish Consequences|‚úÖ||
|Small Feedbacks and Fxs|‚úÖ|Really small stuffs like fade in/out animations HP update etc...|
|Shop and rest area|‚úÖ|
|Ergonomic and QOL|‚ú¥Ô∏è|You can preview what the foe is going to do and what combinaison your going to have but some stuffs are missing|
|Class System|‚ùå|I did not implement classes with abilities and stufss but you can choose differents starting decks|
|Relics and items|‚ùå|I focused on having a strong system and didn't want to mess it up by adding more stuffs|

### Tech üîß

|Objective|Done|Comment|
|---|---|---|
|Scriptable Object architecture that'll allow me to create a lot of consequences|‚úÖ||
|Tools that facilitate consequence management|‚úÖ||
|Observer pattern Implementation for UI and feedbacks|‚úÖ||
|Procedural management |‚ú¥Ô∏è|Each foe is randomly selected from a selected pool and the items you can buy are random but there are no procedure or algorithme yet|
|InGame Debug Tools|‚úÖ| I have cheat Code and stuff ingame
