## Context 

In the summer of 2024 I decided to make a system based game to have something to show and to share to my student as an exemple. 

These last years I have been playing a lot of Deckbuilding Rogue like (Balatro, Slay the spire, Astrea, Wildfrost etc...) and I have been thinking about my take on the genre for a little while. The project I wanted to do for my students was the occasion to put this Idea to the test.

My idea was to make a game where the player can launch action by combining elements. I started brainstorming and a lot of ideas came to my mind so I launched Unity and worked on the first prototype.
