## Context

Detox, is a **platform/couch game** made during a Game Jam. During my internship, I was asked to **restart the project from scratch** and to create **tools to improve the workflow**. I had to work from an office but my colleague and I did not have the sames schedules, I worked a month on this project and I had to change projects very quickly so I didn't have the time to finish what I had started on this project.
​

## What I Did 

I restarted the project from scratch so I had to program the character movements. I used and improved some of my personal tools to quickly prototype the 3c and focus on my main task : a **Level Editor**. 

I did a lot of tests to find the best way to create a Level Editor simple and easy to use.  Eventually I created a **string based serialization system** and I put my **level editor in a build** Instead of an Unity Editor Window. 

I only worked a month on this project so I couldn't finish my Editor but I implemented a system to create walls and moving platforms. 


## What I Learned

This internship pushed me to go **out of my comfort zone** of the Unity Editor to test new methods, new software and  new languages. I could test **new ways to create and implement tools** and I really enjoyed it. I also learned the constraint of a production when you can change projects from one day to another.
