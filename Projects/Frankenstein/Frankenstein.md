## ​Context

**The Wanderer Frankenstein's Creature** is a game based on the book by Mary Shelley, **Frankenstein**,  The game centers on the creature and its quest to find its origins. 

The game is produced by **Arte France**. And it was released on steam, IOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. I only work on the **PC** version.

I started to work on that game barely at the **end of the project**. It also was my first project on a medium-sized team.
​

## What I Did

I did a lot of tasks on this project.  It was the end of the project so a lot of little tasks remained undone. My job was first to **clean** scenes and **Playmaker's scripts**, then I fixed bugs on a few scenes of the game. I Mainly worked on the biggest scene of the project. I cleaned it and I did a little bit of QA to find bugs then I resolved them. I also **integrated** assets for the project, mainly animations.

A few programmers worked on this project before me and there was no cohesion so I did clean and debug scenes with more than 3000 Game objects. To ease my task I took a day to code a **tool so as to find references in PlayMaker**.

## What I Learned

With this project I learned how important it is to have a **well organized project** and to **document and comment** the code for the next people who will work on the project. I also learned how to **work in a medium-sized team** with Sourcetree and Slack. For example we warned our coworkers each times we changed scenes.
