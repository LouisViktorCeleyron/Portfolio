# Teaching Game Programming 


With this job I had to review, work on and supervise a lot of students projects. This allow me to 

## Teaching 

The school had a 3 year program (now it's 4 I think). The first years was focused on mastering the basis of every aspect of game dev. The second year students would have to choose a specialty and the 3rd year was project oriented: the class was divided in 4 or 5 groups and each groups had a year to present a protoype.  

I had to teach them the basis of OOP, and of game dev philosophy. It was essential for me to teach them a logc rather than a software.   
This way, the things they learned with Game Maker, Phaser or Python in first year were translated into Unity and Unreal on the second year etc...

It was really fun for me to work with colleagues to find good excercices that would challenges students while staying iteresting for them. 

Some of the project includes : 

> A **Wario Ware like**:  This project was a way to present Unity to a class. They could focus on one or two mini game and at the end I grouped everything so they could have a finished product for the whole class. This way they also learned how to work with constraint *(I made function for the score and the scene management to facilitate the merge)*

### Expand students' curiosity


## Project Reviewing




Unfortunatly the more I stayed in this job the more I realized I was not in sync with the way the program was applied.

I thought it pushed the student to do a lot of stuff very quickly without letting them time or energy to try to master any of it.
