# My Projects

Here, you can find informations about my projects and what did I do on them! 

### Intro
> Intro is a **RogueLike Deckbuilder** for **PC** made with **Unity** in 2024

It's a **Solo project** I made to challenge my **system programing** skills in Unity and to experiment with a concept I had for a while: a turn based game where you combine elements every turn.

### Teaching Game Dev


### Melobot: A Last Song
> I worked as a freelance for **Anomalie Studio** on their 1st project: a **Rythm and Puzzle game** made in **Unity C#**. I worked with them from **November 2020 to March 2021**

I was hired to be a **general programmer** on the early stage of the project to clean the project and to help with gameplay integration.

### Tough Kookie
> Tough Kookie is a **Beath Them'up** game made with **UE4** in **BP and C++** in **2019-2020**

I mainly was the **head programmer** and the **tool designer** of this project, but I did other tasks too.  
It was our **graduation project**, and we worked more than a year on it. So I had the time to do a lot of stuffs for this project!

### Les Chroniques de Volarela
> I worked as a freelance for **CrossQuest Studio** twice on this educative **point & click** made with **Unity-C#**. My Last Contract with them was on from **June to August 2020**.  

I was hired as a **Tool Designer** by CrossQuest Studio.  
My main task was to design a **dialogue editor** and Unity environement adapted to this project.  
The last time I worked for them I was in charge of an intern. It was a pleasure to teach him all about tool design.

### Detox
> Detox is a **couch-gaming platformer** for **PC**. It is one of the two games on which I worked while I was an **intern** at **La Belle Games** in **2019**. It is made with **Unity 3D**   

We started the game nearly from scratch on Unity 3D and I worked as the only programmer. I work a little more than a month on this game.  
I programmed the base system of the game but my main task was to create a **Level Editor for unity but outside of Unity**.

### The Wanderer: Frankenstein's Creature
>The Wanderer: Frankenstein's Creature is a **Narative Game**. I worked on the **PC** version of the game. It is the other game on which I work at my **intership** at **La Belle Game** in **2019**. It is made with **Unity 3D** and it is produced by **Arte**. 

I join the team of this game barely at the end of the project.  
My tasks on were principally  **debug** or creation of **debugging tools**.  
I mostly worked with the animator and the **PlayMaker Plug-In** and created extentions for it.
