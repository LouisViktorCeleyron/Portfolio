# My Projects

Here, you can find informations about my projects and what did I do on them! 

## Student Project 
### Tough Kookie
> Tough Kookie is a **Beath Them'up** game made with **UE4** in **BP and C++** in **2019-2020**

I mainly was the **head programmer** and the **tool designer** of this project, but I did other tasks too. 

It was our **graduation project**, and we worked more than a year on it. So I had the time to do a lot of stuffs for this project!

## Professional Projects
### Les Chroniques de Volarela
> I worked as a freelance for **CrossQuest Studio** twice on this educative **point & click** made with **Unity-C#**. My Last Contract with them was on from **June to August 2020**.  
I was hired as a **Tool Designer** by CrossQuest Studio.  
My main task was to design a **dialogue editor** and Unity environement adapted to this project.  
The last time I worked for them I was in charge of an intern. It was a pleasure to teach him all about tool design.

### Detox
> Detox is a **couch-gaming platformer**. It is one of the two games on which I worked while I was an **intern** at **La Belle Games** in **2019**. It is made with **Unity 3D**  
We started the game nearly from scratch on Unity 3D and I worked as the only programmer. I work a little more than a month on this game.  
I programmed the base system of the game but my main task was to create a **Level Editor for unity but outside of Unity**.
