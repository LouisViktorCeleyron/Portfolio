Les Chroniques de Volarela is a point'n'click educational game that targets 8 to 12 years-old players. On this game the player incarnates a detective in a fantastic world composed of floating islands, and it must use physical objects provided with the game to solve puzzles.  
I first worked a little bit on the first prototype of the game in the summer of 2017. Then the studio contacted me back for a longer mission in the summer 2018. That project was my **first freelance job**. Then in 2020 they got back to me again.   

## What I Did
My main mission on the project was to design and code **tools to improve the workflow** of the project.   
A part of my mission was to oversaw an **intern**. I taught him the basics of the tool programming. I had to keep in mind that someone will use and modify my scripts, that’s why I tried to create a healthy and professional working and coding environment with, of course, a source control but by commenting my code and making planning and delegating divide the task: I make sure he always has something interesting to do. It was very rewarding to saw him progress and learn.  

The main part of the tool programming we did was the creation of a complex **dialogue editor** adapted to the project.   

I design a **Nodal Dialogue Editor** with a lot of preset nodes that allows the user to create complete and complex dialogues adapted to the game. Each dialogue is a scriptable object, but the tool launches an editor window with its own Inspector.   
The user can set up the colors of the editor, but also the size of the canvas, and the editor has a lot of little features and shortcuts like a mini map for example.

I use the **attribute feature** of C# to create a new kind of Editor: the node editor. With this initiative anyone can create new types of nodes for the editor. The intern used it to create more than 10 various type of node, from the classic “display a text” to more complexes one like “go to another dialogue.”

We also create a **special tab in the project settings** of Unity for the project with a lot of various parameters to create such as global variables or characters for example.

## What I learn

I learnt to work as a **freelancer** and from my home. To manage my workflow and my schedule and to respect deadlines. I Also learned how to manage the french administration being a freelancer.  

I improved my skills on Unity Editor script by always searching new ways to create tools.  

With my last work on the project I learnt how to work with tool designer intern with me. I organized my work plan so he could work and learn new stuff every task. I preview in my planning time for me to teach him tips and tricks or to answer his question.
