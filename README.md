# Hey! 

Nice to meet you! 
>(obviously I'm not "meeting you", this is a .md file but feel free to [contact](https://github.com/LouisViktorCeleyron/Portfolio/blob/master/README.md#ways-to-contact-me) me, I will be delighted to talk with you!)

##  I'm Louis Celeyron 
I’m a **graduate game programmer** at Rubika, Valenciennes, France. I started making games on RPG maker when I was 9, at 12 I continued my tests and my research on **game design and programming** with software like Multimedia Fusion or Construct. 
Today I am still prototyping with this software, however, I use **Unreal Engine 4 (since 2018)** or **Unity (since 2016)** more often.

I have skills in **system, gameplay, and UI/UX programming**, but my real passion is **Tool Programming**, which I started to practice in 2018.

I love **learning** new material, in various fields, such as, of course, Game Design and Game Programming, but also in science, zoology, cooking, cinema, and more!

I also like organizing events. I was on my school student council for 2 year and I spent more time organizing Game Jams than participating in them!
