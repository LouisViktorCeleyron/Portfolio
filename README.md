# Hey! 

Nice to meet you! 

##  I'm Louis Celeyron 


I’m a **Game programmer and designer**. I started making games on RPG maker when I was 9, at 12 I continued my tests and my research on **game design and programming** with software like Multimedia Fusion or Construct. 
Today I am still prototyping with this software, however, I more used to **Unreal Engine 4 (since 2018)**, **Godot (since 2022)** or **Unity (since 2016)**.

After working as a freelance for a few years, I now teach Game Programming in Rennes, France. 

I have skills in **system, gameplay, and UI/UX programming**, but my real passion is **Tool Programming**, which I started to practice in 2018. 

I am a **creative programmer**: I have a real interest about Programming and Design, and I use all theses skills to push the limits of my creativity: I love to prototyping and to create tools that I would use as a Designer.

I love **learning** new material, in various fields, such as, of course, Game Design and Game Programming, but also in science, zoology, cooking, cinema, and more!

I also like organizing events. I was on my school student council for 2 year and I spent more time organizing Game Jams than participating in them!
