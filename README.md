# Louis Celeyron 

That's me, hi! Nice to meet you :)

I’m a **Game programmer and designer**. After working as a freelance for a few years, **since 2022** I teach Game Programming in Rennes, France. 

I started making games on RPG maker when I was 9, at 12 I continued my tests and my research on **game design and programming** with software like Multimedia Fusion or Construct. 
Overall, I really enjoy discovering game engines and frameworks. Even if I didn't work proffesionnaly on all of them I dabbled with :
- Bevy
- Game Maker
- GB Develop
- Pygame
- Etc...

Today I am still prototyping with these softwares and languages, however, I more used to **C++ in Unreal Engine (since 2018), C# and GDL in Godot (since 2022) or C# in Unity (since 2016)**.


I have skills in **gameplay, and UI/UX programming**, but my real passion are **Sytem and Tool Programming**, which I started to practice in 2018. 

I am a **creative programmer**: I have a real interest about Programming and Design, and I use all theses skills to push the limits of my creativity: I love to prototyping and to create tools that I would use as a Designer.


I work as a freelance programmer since 2018 and I worked on numerous projects.   
Since 2021, I worked as a **Game Programming teacher** at Esma Rennes in Britanny, France.


I also like organizing events. I was on my school student council for 2 year and I spent more time organizing **Game Jams** than participating in them! Since then I joined associations to plans Game jams and to introduce people to indie games and more niche side of the video-game industry. 

I love **learning** new material, in various fields, such as, of course, Game Design and Game Programming, but also in science, zoology, cooking, cinema, and more!
