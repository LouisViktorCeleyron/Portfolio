# My General Skills

I have a master’s degree in Video Games Programming and Game Design. I’m defining myself as a creative programmer but for more precision there is a little list of what I can do and my fields of specialization!

## Programming Skills 
### **Tool Design** 
If you have read other pages on my Github you might have noticed that **Tool Design** is my passion in programming. I love to **extend software** to improve them and make them fits the project workflow or simply adapt them to my way of working.  
I read a lot about UX, and my 3 years of studying Game Design help me to **understand ergonomics**; so when I’m creating a tool, I always focus on its simplicity of utilization and on the way it’s going to improve the user’s productivity.  
I’m really curious about this and each time I discover a new software (even when it’s not related to programming like Excel or After Effect for example) I try to understand how I could simplify my future tasks or create an extension to the soft.  

I like to extend software but I’m enjoying the conception of **external tools** too. I’m always enjoying the creation of a Level or Character Editor which can be put in the game later to allow player to create their own content. Most of my external tool returns a string/Json/Xml/anything serialized which can be put in the engine to make something cool.  

[My level editor in Detow is an example of external tool](https://github.com/LouisViktorCeleyron/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Detox/Detox.md#what-i-did)


### **Creativity**
I always have a **lot of ideas in mind**, and I’m often inspired by meaningless things.
The main reason why I love tool design it's because it helps me **prototyping quickly and efficiently**: I'm a creative guy and programming is my main tool to show and express my ideas!  

I think of my tools like games for Designer: their purpose is, of course, to ease a workflow and accelerate a production but when I'm using a tool or making a game I want to have as much fun as playing a game and I want the people who will use my tools and play my games to feel the same way! 

Creativity is the most important thing to me, and I want to create ways for everyone and myself to enjoy it! 

### **Gameplay Programming**
I am very comfortable with the **systemic Gameplay programming** like for RPG or games with huge databases. But I enjoy working on any type of gamplay. I know how to create behaviour and scriptable object in C# for Unity and to create flexible components and actors for Unreal Engine.  
My way of doing Gameplay Programming is to quickly **prototype** something to test then to restart it from scratch, knowing where I’m going, to make something clean.

### **Hierarchy and architectures**

I’m very fond of a **clean hierarchy and architecture**, that’s why I always take the time to think about what I’m going to do in advance and how I’m going to do it. Or I prototype first then I restart the project with an architecture in mind.  
I use very often a child/parent class system with interfaces, structures etc… and I factorize a lot. I don’t like to use copy/past and I have the tendency to **factorize** each time a code portion is appearing more than once.
I also used **design patterns** to improve my way of programming.  

### **Mathematics skills**
I had the opportunity to exercise my mathematics skills on my different projects. I have algebra and 3D math skills, I’m familiar with the utilization of mathematic function and I’m used to 2D and 3D vector.

## Languages 
### **C#**
Since 2016 I have learnt how to use most of the **C# features** in my projects (mainly on unity). For example, the attributes, the interfaces, the generic methods, Dictionaries, and my little favourite: the delegates (I have the tendency to put delegates everywhere.).  

### **C++**
I first learnt a little of C before I transition to C++. I have knowledge about the language to read it, modify it and create a little project in C++. I know how to use pointers, the header/.cpp principle, etc...  
C++ is a deep language with a lot of particularities, but I’m enjoying each step I’m making in my journey to improve my skills in it!  

### **Other Languages**
I practised these languages long time ago, and I’m practicing them when I have the time but way less often than C# and C++. I did some **Ruby, JavaScripts and Python.**

## Game Design
I studied Game design during my firsts 3 years at Rubika. This experience gave me a **good capacity of analysis** and helps me to pull out the best of what I’m seeing, listening, or playing. I have a **creative mind** which is pushing me to think outside the box and to always being innovative and thinking of new ways of doing stuffs.  
My game design skills combined with my programming skills allow me **to prototype my ideas** and to test them to see what is right and what is wrong. One of the aspects of Game Design that interest me the most is the **UX** and I am putting what I learnt in my tools or in my prototypes!  
When I studied Game Design, I learnt how to make efficient research and documentation and I apply this however the field I’m currently working on.  
My Game Designs Skills allows me to do **creative programming** and to always try to get out of my comfort zone.

## Other Softwares  
I’m curious, and I try to stay updated about **new or indie software and technology** that can interest me and I’m taking time to test them!  
I also have skills in other software than Unity or Unreal Engine!  

### **Source Control System**
I did a lot of projects in teams, so I had a lot of occasion to try and use Source Control System and softwares. I'm very confortable with Git(Github/SourceTree) and SVN (Tortoise)

### **Games Softwares**
I started making game like 10 years ago using Rpg Maker, Fusion2, construct and Game Maker and I used them a lot before I start learning programming.  
I still used them once in a while, and I’m starting to use Godot and Buildbox as well to get my head of Unity and Unreal and try something else!  

### **Art & Video Softwares**
Video Games is not the only thing that interest me, and I love to do some other creative stuff!  
I’m familiar with the Adobe softs, especially After effect, Illustrator and photoshop and I like to do some experimentation on them when I have the time.   
I like too to discover new indie software like Aesprite, Spritestack, etc…  

### **Organization Software**
I’m used to work in teams, so I can use Organization and management software as Trello Jira, or confluence. 
I’m a big fan of the google suite, especially google sheets, to share documentation and planning for example.

## Soft Skills 
### **Communication**
I’m familiar with the teamwork, in fact the majority of my projects **were realized by a team of more than 5 peoples**. Per consequent I know how important a good communication is in a team, and I always make the maximum to share informations with everyone.  
I’m used to work and **communicate with Designer, Prgrammers, Artist, and Producer** but also with people who are not from the video game industry; I used to work with people from animation movies and from industrial design industries.
I was an intern and I had an intern, so I have the ability to communicate with everyone in a hierarchy. 
And I’m always trying to think about the needs of my coworkers and the things I can do to improve our ways of working all together.  


### **Learning**
I cannot get tired of **learning new stuffs**: softs, technology, techniques, etc… I learn fast: I’m resourceful, curious, and I’m always in the quest of understanding the tools I’m using.  
I’m not afraid of doing experiment and trying again and again until I understand and master things!
